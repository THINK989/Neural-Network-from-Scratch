# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains a Deep Neural Network implemented in scratch. The code is divided and kept as seperate .py files so that code 
is more readable. The architecture is explained completely in the .ipynb file in `/MLP_from _scratch/` folder. 
The neural network is used for classification of results of Dota 2 games.

## To RUN it on your computer

**Follow the steps given below:-**

- Click on Download ZIP, and a .zip will be downloaded to your PC
![Download ZIP](https://github.com/THINK989/Neural-Network-from-Scratch/blob/master/Images/download_zip.JPG)


- Then Open Jupyter Notebook, if you dont have jupyter notebook download Anaconda3
![Anaconda3 Python](https://github.com/THINK989/Neural-Network-from-Scratch/blob/master/Images/anaconda3.JPG)


- If you already have jupyter notebook, open and create a new folder
![new folder](https://github.com/THINK989/Neural-Network-from-Scratch/blob/master/Images/new_folder.JPG)


- Then upload all the files from .zip file. Make sure you uplaid all the files in the same folder
![upload](https://github.com/THINK989/Neural-Network-from-Scratch/blob/master/Images/upload.JPG)


**Open Multi Layer Perceptron.ipynb and run each cell, play with the code**. I recommend you to also visit all other .py files and try 
different option for different segments to understand the working even more precisely. The .ipynb file has all the details of architecture 
and an optional guide to play around with the code.
